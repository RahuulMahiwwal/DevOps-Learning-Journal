# 🛠️ Ansible - Configuration Management Module 🛠️

---

**⚒️ Tools and Concepts Covered ⚒️**
- What is Ansible? Agentless vs Agent-based tools
- Ansible architecture (Control node, Managed nodes, SSH-based)
- Inventory files (static and dynamic)
- Ansible Ad-hoc commands vs Playbooks
- YAML syntax and best practices
- Modules (copy, file, service, apt, yum, shell, debug, etc.)
- Handlers, Variables, Loops, and Templates (Jinja2)
- Role-based automation structure
- Integration with Jenkins for deployment

---

**💻 Hands-on Activities 💻**
- Installed Ansible on control node (Ubuntu VM)
- Created inventory files with multiple managed nodes (e.g., dev/prod)
- Used ad-hoc commands to install packages and start/stop services
- Wrote and executed Ansible playbooks to:
  - Set up Apache, Docker, and custom applications
  - Copy files, configure permissions, restart services
  - Manage users and permissions
- Created reusable Ansible roles for application deployments
- Integrated Ansible with Jenkins for automated post-build deployments

---

**🧠 Key Learnings 🧠**
- Automating server configuration and provisioning
- Writing idempotent and reusable playbooks
- Using inventory files and group variables for multi-node setups
- Structuring Ansible roles for real-world use
- Connecting CI/CD pipelines with Ansible for zero-touch deployment
